                (About this sound pronunciation (help·info)) refers to any person who regards themselves as culturally, ethnically, or religiously
                adhering to aspects of Hinduism.[1][2] It has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for
                people indigenous to South Asia.[3][4]
                The historical meaning of the term Hindu has evolved with time. Starting with the Persian and Greek references to the land of the Indus
                in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era,[5] the term Hindu implied a geographic, ethnic or cultural identifier
                for people living in the Indian subcontinent around or beyond the Sindhu (Indus) river.[6] By the 16th century, the term began to refer
                to residents of the subcontinent who were not Turkic or Muslims.[6][a][b]
                The historical development of Hindu self-identity within the local South Asian population, in a religious or cultural sense, is unclear.
                [3][7] Competing theories state that Hindu identity developed in the British colonial era, or that it developed post-8th century CE after
                the Islamic invasion and medieval Hindu-Muslim wars.[7][8][9] A sense of Hindu identity and the term Hindu appears in some texts dated
                between the 13th and 18th century in Sanskrit and regional languages.[8][10] The 14th- and 18th-century Indian poets such as Vidyapati,
                Kabir and Eknath used the phrase Hindu dharma (Hinduism) and contrasted it with Turaka dharma (Islam).[11] The Christian friar Sebastiao
                Manrique used the term 'Hindu' in religious context in 1649.[12] In the 18th century, the European merchants and colonists began to refer
                to the followers of Indian religions collectively as Hindus, in contrast to Mohamedans for Mughals and Arabs following Islam.[3][6] By the
                mid-19th century, colonial orientalist texts further distinguished Hindus from Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains,[3] but the colonial laws
                continued to consider all of them to be within the scope of the term Hindu until about mid-20th century.[13] Scholars state that the
                custom of distinguishing between Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs is a modern phenomenon.[14][15] Hindoo is an archaic spelling variant,
                whose use today may be considered derogatory.[16][17]
