                <br />All Saints' Day, also known as All Hallows' Day, Hallowmas, Feast of All Saints,or Solemnity of All Saints，is a Christian festival celebrated in honour of all the saints.
                <br />Christian celebration of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day stems from a belief that there is a powerful spiritual bond between those in heaven (the "Church triumphant"), and the living (the "Church militant").
                <br />In the Western Christian practice, the liturgical celebration begins at Vespers on the evening of 31 October, All Hallows' Eve (All Saints' Eve), and ends at the close of 1 November. It is thus the day before All Souls' Day, which commemorates the faithful departed. In many traditions, All Saints' Day is part of the triduum of Allhallowtide, which lasts three days from 31 October to 2 November inclusive.
                <br />To celebrate the advent of Halloween, children will be dressed as a variety of cute ghosts knocking on door to door, asking for confectionery, otherwise they will make trouble. At the same time this legend at the same time, all kinds of ghosts will also dress up as children mixed with the masses to celebrate the advent of Halloween, and humans to make the ghost more harmonious before it dressed as a variety of ghosts.
